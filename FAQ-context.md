[ConTeXt](http://www.pragma-ade.com/) is a macro package created by
Hans Hagen of Pragma ADE (which stands for Advanced Document
Engineering); it started as a production tool for Pragma (which is a
publishing company).  ConTeXt is a document-production system based,
like LaTeX, on the TeX typesetting system.  Whereas LaTeX insulates the
writer from typographical details, ConTeXt takes a complementary
approach by providing structured interfaces for handling typography,
including extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks,
presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation.
It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it
easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the TeX macro
language. ConTeXt's unified design avoids the package clashes that can
happen with LaTeX.

ConTeXt also integrates MetaFun, a superset of MetaPost and a powerful
system for vector graphics.  MetaFun can be used as a stand-alone
system to produce figures, but its strength lies in enhancing ConTeXt
documents with accurate graphic elements.

The development of [LuaTeX](FAQ-xetex-luatex) was originally driven by
ConTeXt, almost from the start of its project.  Nowadays, ConTeXt it is
distributed in two versions&nbsp;&mdash; mark two (files with extension
`.mkii`) which runs on pdfTeX but is not under active development, and
mark four (files with extension `.mkiv`) (which runs on LuaTeX and is
where development happens).

ConTeXt has a large developer community (though possibly not as large
as that of LaTeX), but those developers who are active seem to have
prodigious energy.  Support is available via the [ConTeXt
Garden](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) and via the [mailing
list](https://mailman.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/ntg-context). A
"standalone" distribution (a TeX distribution with no macros other than
ConTeXt-based ones) is available as ["ConTeXt
Standalone"](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Standalone) (also
known as "ConTeXt Minimals" or the "ConTeXt Suite") &mdash; it provides
a ConTeXt system on any of a number of platforms, executing either
Mark&nbsp;II or Mark&nbsp;IV ConTeXt.

Note that CTAN does _not_ hold the primary distribution of
ConTeXt&nbsp;&mdash; potential users should refer to the [ConTeXt
Garden](http://contextgarden.net) for details of the current
distribution.
